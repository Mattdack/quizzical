## Description 

This [Quizzical Website](mattdack.github.io/quizzical) provides a quiz for users to take to evaluate how nerdy and well rounded they are. The site utilizes on-click event tracking to determine user answer selection and evaluate validity. An interval timer is used to evaluate score. Javascript dynamically updates the page with new questions upon answer selection as well as CSS styling to provide real time feedback. Lastly, the site takes advantage of local storage properties to allow users to track scores on their device.
